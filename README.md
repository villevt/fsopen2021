# fsopen2021
My submissions for the Full Stack Open 2021 - MOOC.

Decided to take the course to improve my web development skills - while I have done some dabbling around, I think this course would improve my ability to properly undertake *full stack development*.

The submissions are organized according to the parts in the course with the folder structure fsopen2021/part(number)/(exercise), with each exercise having a short markdown explanation.
